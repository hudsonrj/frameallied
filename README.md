# FrameAllied

This repository provides a simple structure for a secure web application with
separated backend and frontend components. Node.js is used for the API server
and React for the UI, while Python is used for optional data analysis and
machine learning tasks.

## Structure

- `backend/` – Express API with security middleware.
- `frontend/` – React application powered by Vite.
- `ml/` – Python scripts for data analysis and machine learning.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies for each component and follow the instructions in the
respective `README.md` files.
